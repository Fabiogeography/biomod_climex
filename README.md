R codes for evaluating and ensembling projections of species' potential distributions from biomod2 (traditional Species Distribution Models, 'SDMs') and CLIMEX. The codes can be applied to any species for which you have presence data, environmental data, and a CLIMEX model. 

The codes are data are from 'Combining traditional Species Distribution Models and CLIMEX to forecast the global distribution of Tuta absoluta. Early et al., in submission). Please see that paper for more details, or contact the lead author (regan.early@gmail.com)

The distribution data provided (pres.csv and presence_pseudoabs.csv) are the subset of data used in Early et al. that can be shared publically, and not the full dataset used in the paper. The SDMs produced by this code will not match those in the paper, and should not be considered the most accurate projections available. 

This approach is only appropriate for comparing SDMs and CLIMEX models made with same environmental data.
